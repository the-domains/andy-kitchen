# About Andy

Andy Kitchen is a crazy programmer with a big heart. When he was a kid, the first program he ever wrote was an "AI". He though this was the coolest thing ever. Later, he realised it was a chat-bot. He is now a researcher and consultant in machine learning, specialising in neural networks. He is currently puzzling over how to teach computers to think about thinking and other meta-physical machinations.
