I'm [speaking at OSCON][0] 2016 in Austin, TX on 2016-05-18

## Abracada-BRAIN!

> "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic"

...And by extension, cutting edge technology should be just a little bit magical. Andy Kitchen pulls back the curtain on the state of the art in machine learning. He uses clear and simple explanations along with live interactive demos to turbo charge the audiences' understanding.

Machine Learning is often presented from a dense mathematical perspective: while necessary for rigorous research, it obscures the intuitive nature of machine learning. The goal of this talk is to explain to a general audience how (any why) deep learning works: where it came from; what it is capable of; and what the future holds.

This talk focuses on presenting what is possible and exciting right now rather than speculating on the future of Artificial Intelligence or its possible impact on society. All live demos in the talk are open source, fully functional implementations of algorithms from peer-reviewed publications. Some are even written in JavaScript and run in your browser, and you can git clone them all today.

Cut through the hype and speculation, find out how it all works and why you should _genuinely___be excited --- and energized to start hacking. It's time for human learning about machine learning.
